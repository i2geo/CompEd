1. Reverted your pom settings for maven-compiler-plugin. It was already set.

2. I had to outcomment ActiveMath dependency/repository. It introduced some strange NoSuchField Exception: TRACE.

Release Notes:
1. CompEd allows for viewing competencies/topics.
2. It displays competencies/topics in a list and on a single
   page.
3. The default name is devised from the URL. Hence,it is always in
   English.
4. Competencies also point to their specifications/generalizations.
5. Competency Types and Descriptions are considered are represented by
   one Java class. Note, types have no names so far.
6. Topics/Competencies display names according to their name type.

7. Synchronization is done only in one way, from Ontology to CompEd.
   A maven plugin for comped was developed which generates an xml file
   from a template and the ontology which is taken from the official
   http address. The generated file can be inserted into the database
   in a next step.

   Information that CompEd stores that is not in the ontology comprises:
   - name of the creator
   - created datestamp
   - modified datestamp
   - status (Public, Draft, ...)
   - comment status (open for comments, closed, ...)
   - comment days (allow comments for a certain time period.

   This information is in principle not necessary to run CompEd. The
   plugin will substitute this information by default values.

Minor issues to be done (takes 24 hours):
- set a "verb" boolean property on competencies to distinguish between
  classes and instances.
- make an index on the name field to allow for a simple alphabetical
  sorting.
- make uri property unique
